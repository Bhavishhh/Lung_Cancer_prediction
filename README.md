# Lung_Cancer_prediction

This project aims to develop a reliable Lung Cancer prediction model based on a set of observed values. To achieve this, a Random Forest model is employed for data analysis, as it is known for its effectiveness in handling complex datasets. The available dataset is carefully divided into two subsets: the training data, used to train the model, and the test data, used to assess its predictive performance.
